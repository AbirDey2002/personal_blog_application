**"こんにちは、みんな"**

If you search up why should one learn Japanese on google, the first prompt that pops says -

> The Japanese make up the third largest language community on the Internet, after only English and Chinese speakers. An estimated 88 million Japanese, or 9.6% of the world's online population, are connected to the Internet. Knowing Japanese can connect you to these people in an instant.

## Why did I?

Yesterday out university hosted a pre-placement talk with [**Zenken India**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zenkenindia/) for the final year B. tech students for an opportunity to learn the Japanese language, the people and most importantly work over there. Our placement head, Shriram sir told us, day before yesterday to visit the campus, attend the ppt, it will be a _life changing_ opportunity.

Obviously I attended the session, hosted by [Mr. Abhishek Gowda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-sn-gowda-52118b88/) at **Zenken India**. The session was delightful, had some wonderful insights to what _Japan is all about_. I'll share what he told me down below but yeah, it was a lovely session overall.

The we had a session with Shriram sir himself. We talked about how seriously we should take this opportunity, how your approach towards this matters and not let your tiredness and feeling hinder the performance.

> If someone says no to you, you should get up and prove them wrong    

Exactly his words

The only requirement this job profile has that I don't - **you should be N3 proficient in japanese**

Now I am on a deadline and yes this is a career biased motive but why should you learn japanese? and what did I learn? coming up 👇

## Why should you?

Learning a new language is a fascinating adventure. It is a journey full of excitement, enthralling experience, occasional challenges, vivid illustration, unusual and unexpected encounters. 

The countless benefits of acquiring a new language are undeniable. Of all the in-demand foreign languages, why choose Japanese? 

To start with, let us explore three compelling reasons. 

**First**, the Japanese will set you apart from the crowd. It is different because it isn’t an uncomplicated language to embrace. **Second**, career-wise, Japanese is one of the top 5 most useful languages to study. **Last but not least**, the colorful and vigorous cultural aspect of Japan. 

Japanese is the most popular choice among East Asian Languages, and the reasons are apparent. Roughly 127 million people speak Japanese in Japan. One can also find sizeable Japanese speakers in Korea, Taiwan, England, Canada, Brazil, the USA, and the Philippines. It is also one of the most widely used languages on the Internet. While no official data seems to exist, it is generally assumed that a vast majority are monolingual. It means very few people speak any other language, including English. One main reason is they take pride in their native language, and there is no such thing as “English for Japanese.”

#### Summing it up -

As it was in the pre-placement talk

- Job stability
- Global exposure and competence
- Diverse and can do mindset
- Supportive employment conditions
- New culture and language
- Professional growth

## What have I learnt so far 

I'll make this a series from the next blog, for now let's look at what _Japanese is all about_.

### Introduction

Japanese is a _mora timed language_ meaning all the japanese character take equal pronounciation time, unlike English which is a stress-timed language.

**す(su)み(mi)ま(ma)せ(se)ん(n)** meaning _Excuse me / I am sorry_

I'll talk about the japanese alphabet as well but try to pronounce all the characters in _equal time_.

Perfect, you are half way there to perfect japanese pronunciation.

### Japanese Alphabet (Hiragana)

Japanese language has **3 scripts**, _Hiragana is the most widely used one_, both because of it's japanese origin as well as the grammatical structure of the language.

Japanese has 5 vowels just like English alphabet -

**あ(aa)** - _a_  
**い(ee)** - _i_  
**う(uw)** - _u_  
**え(ae)** - _e_  
**え(ou)** - _o_  

The can also be related to the matras in hindi.

After the vowels, come the remaining characters of the script, which are a mixture of some consonant sounds plus these above-mentioned vowels as well.

#### What does it mean?

Suppose under the _**column n**_

the letters are pronounced as - 

**な(N + aa)** as na  
**に(N + ee)** as ni  
**ぬ(N + uw)** as nu  
**ね(N + ae)** as ne  
**の(N + ou)** as no  

To end this blog, I would like to teach you guys on last handy word which you must have heard atleast once in your life already.

**ありがとう** pronounced as Arigatō means **Thankyou** in english 

## ありがとう

To you guys as well as [**Zenken India**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zenkenindia/) and [**Shriram R**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shriramsr/) sir
